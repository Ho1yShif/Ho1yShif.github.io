# Shifra Isaacs's Portfolio Website
A space to introduce myself and share my professional accomplishments

## TODO
- Write test to determine if resume link works; if it doesn't, email me to update the link
  - Or find a way to search my Google drive for the name so it auto updates
- Fill website with my content:
  - Top Menu
  - Add poetry/articles/non technical writing?
  - Top left logo
  - Tab Icon
  - Set up hyperlinks for links inside work exepreience section
  - Separate work experience section into Tech Writing and Data work with two buttons that render separate data
  - Remove separation lines between sections
  - Add Thank you section: Nick, Constant, Brian, Zack, Mom
  - Move icons right under intro description
  - Add Dinner project
  -
- Once website looks good, remove as much of the old Shiv stuff as I can
