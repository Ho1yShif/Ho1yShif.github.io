# Shifra Isaacs's Portfolio Website
A space to introduce myself and share my professional accomplishments

## TODO
- Write test to determine if resume link works; if it doesn't, email me to update the link
  - Or find a way to search my Google drive for the name so it auto updates
- Fill website with my content:
  - Top Menu
  - Experience
  - Writing
  - Top left logo
  - Tab Icon
  - Copyright at bottom
  - Make headshot not cut off on the right
  - Set up hyperlinks for links inside work exepreience section
- Once website looks good, remove as much of the old Shiv stuff as I can
